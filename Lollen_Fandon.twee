You're better than you thought.
''This will increase your Persuasive by an uncertain but significant amount, at the price of five Confident Smiles.''

They turn and look when you pass. Oh yes they do.

:: Ask a friend to cover for you {"position":"450,250"}
You were nowhere near the place! Ask this upstanding citizen!
''This will invite a friend to assist you.''
<h3>When Sent</h3>
''A potential alibi''
If your friend's prepared to bend the truth, the Constables will have a hard time making this one stick.

Suspected by the Constables [Friend's name] (+1)

<h3>In Messages Tab</h3>
<h4>You will receive:</h4>
You have asked [Friend's name] to help with the Suspicion surrounding you.

<h4>Your friend will receive:</h4>
The Constables are investigating [your name]. Could you help them, and lower their Suspicion?


:: Ask someone for help in laying rumours to rest {"position":"450,1475"}
The wicked things they say! You need a faithful friend to pooh-pooh this nonsense.
''With help, you can reduce Scandal.''
<h3>When Sent</h3>
''The request is sent''
Perhaps your friend will help you. If not, perhaps you should seek a small revenge.

Hoping for Help With a Scandal [Friend's name] (+1)
<h3>In Messages Tab</h3>
<h4>You will receive:</h4>
Hopefully [friend] will be willing to help redeem your good name!

<h4>Your friend will receive:</h4>
[Your name] needs you to divert attention from their sins. Can you trust them?


:: Attend a Church Service {"position":"450,1700"}
An honest change of heart? Or just the tribute paid by vice to virtue?
''You may find your Scandal reduced a little.''
<<for _x range 100>>
  <<if _x < 70>>
    <h3>Success</h3>
    ''An uplifting and profitable hour''
    Your reputation is a little improved, and several of the congregation are attractive enough that you even consider returning next week.
    <<changePoints $scandal "-2">>

    <h3>Failure</h3>
    ''An uplifting but unprofitable hour''
    Other churchgoers frown and tut, and the vicar makes unflattering mention of you in his sermon. Still, several of the congregation are attractive enough that you don't feel your time was entirely wasted.

A Constable is frantically chasing a spiralling mass of papers down the street, snatching any that come within range. Passers-by hand them to him or surreptitiously grab them and tuck them away. One trips him up just as a document lands at your feet.

''This will help you with Suspicion.''

<h1>Success</h1>
''A pleasing piece of luck''

Interestingly, it's a list with your name at the bottom. You say nothing as the Constable charges, wailing, past.
