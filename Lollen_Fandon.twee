:: A disturbance outside {"position":"675,1300"}
''Action Cost: 3''
Someone is shouting, probably at someone else. That's how it usually works.

<<if _x <= 60>>
  <h3>Success</h3>
  ''Inventive invective'''
  The argument goes on for a good hour. It explores the pedigree, the reputation and the anatomical idiosyncracies of both participants in some detail. It's not exactly soothing, but it is entertaining.

  ''On and on''
  The disagreement is partly political, partly personal and wholly uninteresting. One party screeches like an owl in a well: the other affects a pedantic nasal whine. You bury your head under your pillow and eventually it stops. […]

''Action Cost: 3''
Candles sink low. Gas-lamps burn pale. Footsteps are hushed. Even the rats have ceased to scurry.

<h3>Success</h3>
''The arms of Morpheus''
You awake refreshed, invigorated. A rasher gentleman might even leap from bed. You reserve your energies. But matters have improved.

:: An old street sign {"position":"500,2350"}
When London was kneaded into its new form, the Masters declared the old street signs contraband. They say you can still find them in the Flit if you're quick and lucky. Fancy a climb?
<<set _proba to tw.probability(60, $shadowy, 70)>>

  <h3>Success</h3>
  ''Quick and lucky and wise''
  Even the Raggedy Men have stopped looking for street signs. But you know better. Your prize is two hundred feet above ground, nailed to a factory chimney and black with soot

Your ability in one area has been long recognised. It is time for your other skills to be acknowledged.
''This will reset your Person of Some Importance specialisation for the cost of 12 Notability. This will not remove London's Marrow, Sinew, Blood, or Nerves, if you have obtained any of those qualities.''
<h3>Success</h3>

  <h3>Success</h3>
  ''Surprisingly welcome''
  First, a Dauntless Temperance Campaigner with a hearty potato-soup for the convalescent. Next, an acquaintance with a bottle of decent wine. Finally, some lout with a bill, but you hide under the covers until they're gone.

A Raggedy Man, one of the Flit's beggars, will show you around if you bring something for the stew.

<h3>Success</h3>
''Off you go'''
The Raggedy Man keeps an eye on the rat-sack as you climb. Twice he warns you against dropping it. The Flit is a hungry place.
''You're heading to The Flit. When you leave, you won't be able to return unless you open up the route at your lodgings or find another Raggedy Man like this one. The Flit is most interesting for those who have Shadowy 60+.''
